It's really important to me to show that anyone who wants to can start to get into composing, so that's why I posted my first ever tracks (cryo) in 2022 just a few months after starting.\n\nIn the following time, I started listening to a lot of daft punk's records and got more into house music, which in particular impressed me with their crisp and clear drum design and made me learn more about mixing tracks. I also started listening to more soundtracks from various games (machinarium, the eternal cylinder, cult of the lamb, celeste), a culture that is really amazing in showing that good music doesn't have to have vocals, and composing instrumentals can convey just as much meaning and emotion."
